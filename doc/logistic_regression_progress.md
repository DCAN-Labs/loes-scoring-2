Unfortunately, these results still show that your model isn't working effectively. The key issues remain:

1. <b>Specificity is still 0.0000</b> - The model isn't identifying any negative cases correctly
2. <b>Recall/Sensitivity is 1.0000</b> - The model is classifying everything as positive
3. AUC has actually decreased to 0.4331<b> (below 0.5), which is worse than random guessing</b>

The model is still predicting all samples as positive, which gives a reasonable accuracy only because your dataset is imbalanced with more positive samples.
Since you've likely tried:

* Different thresholds
* Class weighting
* Learning rate adjustments
* Data augmentation

It may be time to consider more fundamental changes:

1. <b>Try a different model architecture</b> - Your current model may not have enough capacity to learn the complex patterns in MRI data
2. <b>Use transfer learning</b> - Start with a pre-trained CNN on medical images and fine-tune it
3. <b>Feature engineering</b> - Work with radiologists to identify specific regions or features in the MRIs that are most predictive
4. <b>Consider a different problem formulation</b> - Instead of binary classification, try regression on the Loes score directly, or anomaly detection where ALD is treated as an anomaly
5. <b>Data preprocessing improvements</b> - Ensure your MRI preprocessing pipeline is optimally extracting relevant features

The consistent specificity of 0 across multiple experiments strongly suggests that there may be fundamental issues with either the data representation or the model's ability to learn from this data.
